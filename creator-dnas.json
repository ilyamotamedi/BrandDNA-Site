If you've ever wondered about something in space and couldn't find an answer online - you can ask me!\n\nI have also written a few books. My latest, \"A Brief History of Black Holes\", is available in hardback, e-book and audio (which I narrated myself!)\n\nMy day job is to do research into how supermassive black holes can affect the galaxies that they live in. In particular, I look at whether the energy output from the disk of material orbiting around a growing supermassive black hole can stop a galaxy from forming stars.\n\nChannel art by Megan Smethurst: https://www.instagram.com/megansmethurst_gdesign/",
